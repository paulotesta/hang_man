# hang_man

## _Sample Python game_

Hang Man is the famous game coded using Python programing.

## Instructions

To start the program you'll need python 3 installed on your system and type:

```sh
python3 hang_man.py
```

The user must select one character at a time and try to guess the correct word, using the blank spaces as guidance.

Each round either the user selected a letter that is present in the word or not. If the letter is present, it will fill the blanks. If the letter is incorrect, the figure of the hang man will start to be drawn and the user will have another chance to get it right.

The games end with the user guessing the word correctly or hanging the man.
